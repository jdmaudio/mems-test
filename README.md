# Sky360 Sound Sensor


## Requirements
- Price: as with all aspects of the sky360 system a balance must be struck between price vs capability. High cost per unit will limit the number of sensor nodes and, consequently, the coverage of the network. Data aquired from a low cost microphone could be

- Microphone: should ideally support an operating frequency in the range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz

- Outdoors exposure: The device has to operate outdoors for long periods of time during which it will be exposed to winds and rains. Therefore, it requires effective protection against adverse atmospheric conditions.
